# Bayesian-Classification-with-Gaussian-Distributions    
## Intro to Probabilistic AI Models:   
**Bayesian Classification** is a probabilistic model based on Bayes’ Theorem.
It predicts class membership by calculating the posterior probability of each class.
This method is widely used for its simplicity, efficiency.  
## objects:   
- Simulate data from two different normal distributions representing two classes.    
- Estimate the likelihoods and priors.    
- Build and evaluate a Bayes classifier that assigns each point to the most probable class using Bayes' theorem.    
- Measure the model’s performance on test data.     
### Step 1: Simulate Two Gaussian Distributions       
We first generate two sets of data:   
- Class 1 (X1) with mean = -2 and standard deviation (ecart) = 1     
- Class 2 (X2) with mean = 2 and standard deviation = 1     
We generate:   
- 10,000 samples from X1    
- 20,000 samples from X2
